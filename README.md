So for this project, I created a new sheet separate from the original data so I don't tamper with that. I copied the original data into the new sheet I created
I removed duplicates then I checked each columns for errors and how I can give more understanding to the data 
I then created a pivot table which I created a visualization through 
Then I created a new sheet where I brought all my visualizations to and arranged them in a good and understandable manner
